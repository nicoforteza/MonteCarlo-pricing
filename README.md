# MonteCarlo-pricing
The aim of the following code is to price a call option in which the underlying asset follows a Constant Elasticity Variance Process. MonteCarlo simulations are made to simulate the expected and theoretical value of the option. Some conditions that I propose must be cumplimented: there are 3 stages of time for the price of the underlying within the life of the option that must be within an interval, defined by alpha (lower bound) and beta (upper bound). If this condition is fulfilled, the payoff activates for that stage of time, otherwise not. The total payoff will be the expected mean of the payoffs of each stage of time.
